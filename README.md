# **Maze Path Finder**

This repository contains an interactive program designed to solve mazes using the **A\*** (A-star) pathfinding algorithm. The program allows users to define a **start point**, an **endpoint**, and draw **barriers** (obstacles) within the maze. The solution utilizes the **Manhattan distance heuristic** to compute the most efficient path from the start to the destination.

## **Features**

- **Customizable Maze Layout**:  
  Users can manually place a **start point**, an **endpoint**, and **barriers** (walls) within the maze grid to design unique maze layouts.

- **Efficient Pathfinding**:  
  The program implements the **A\*** pathfinding algorithm, which uses the **Manhattan distance heuristic** to calculate the shortest possible path between the start and endpoint while avoiding obstacles.

- **Real-time Visualization**:  
  The program provides a **visualization** of the maze-solving process, highlighting the exploration of nodes and demonstrating how the algorithm searches for the most efficient path to the destination. The solution path is displayed once found.
